There are many App Extensions available in iOS, in this tutorial we will see steps for creating  Todays Extension also known as a Widget. Let us create an app called My Address which retrieves user’s current location and reverse geocodes in to Address. My Address App Extension (Todays Extension) shows users current address in a Widget as shown the below screenshot. The coordinate is reverse geocoded into address using Apple’s CLGeocoder API.
